A `pdm` plugin to check if your project dependencies support specific Python version.

> [!NOTE]  
> Many packages may still work just fine even when they are not listed as supported.
> This plugin only checks the metadata provided by the package authors, so it is not
> a guarantee that the package will work or not.

## Synopsis

The readiness report is divided into 4 sections:

- **Supported dependencies** - currently locked dependencies that support the target Python version.
- **Update required** - currently locked dependencies that do not support the target Python version, but have newer versions that do.
- **Unsupported** - dependencies: the most recent version of the dependency does not support the target Python version.
- **Missing metadata** - the package does not provide metadata about the supported Python versions.

Plugins uses [PyPI JSON API](https://warehouse.pypa.io/api-reference/json.html) to get the metadata.
It looks at classifiers like `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12` to determine which versions are supported.

## Installation

pdm self add pdm-readiness
